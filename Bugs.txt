Bug 1: Heap corruption.
	This can happen in a number of ways, but primarily triggers in the text init.
	Putting a print statement before this will cause it to error at that print statement.
	However, putting a print statement before trigInit, or setting trigInit to 4, will not cause a break at the print.
	Commenting out the line of memset will instead cause the heap to corrupt in load geometry
	Various different things can control where the heap error occurs, from changing the malloc size to adding variables.
Main Causes:
	Upon further inquiry the heap corrupts at a3trigInit(); Commenting out this function causes all the initializations to work. It also returns a very large value which overflows the heap
		This could either be memset not setting the array properly or the trigInit handling the array incorrectly

Fix:
	Set the trigTable to contain more values (5859) and set the degrees to 2. I was able to find these numbers using a3trigInitSamplesRequired
